# England_WSL_22-23

This study examines the Women's Super League in England for the 2022/2023 season, focusing on various positions on the field and comparing players based on their performances. Midfielders' main performance indicators include passing, ball possession, tackling, and support play. Post-Shot Expected Goals (PSxG) were used in assessing a goalkeeper's ability, it combines shot quality with what happened to the shot, allowing us to assess a goalkeeper's shot-stopping ability more effectively than other statistics such as clean sheets or saves per 90 minutes which could be a direct result of a solid defence in front of them. The best players in different positions were selected based on their performances throughout the season, Defenders were selected based on the overall clean sheet they kept. Midfielders were selected based off the number of goal and shot scoring actions they had which includes assists, which is simply the number of passes they made that resulted directly into a goal. Forward players were selected based on the number of goal contributions they had. These results were used to compile a Team of the Season.
